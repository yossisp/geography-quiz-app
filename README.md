# geography-quiz-app
### A cross-platform app which initiates a multiple-choice quiz on geographical topics. The app was written in Java and runs on [JVM](https://java.com/en). [Swing Framework](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/architecture-142923.html) was used for GUI components.

To run the app:

1. Make sure you have [JRE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre9-downloads-3848532.html) or [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html) installed. 
2. Download or clone the repository.
3. In terminal run the following commands: `cd src && javac *.java` and `java QuizApp &`.

A new window will open and the quiz will be started.

The app uses the file `quiz.txt` in `resoures` directory in order to read questions.
